# Health Checkup Data Preprocessing and Cleaning

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on **cleaning and preprocessing a health screening dataset**. The dataset contains information collected from medical checkups, including demographic details, physical measurements, lab results, and lifestyle indicators such as smoking habits and oral health.

This project **does not focus on modeling**, but rather demonstrates strong **data wrangling, cleaning, and preprocessing techniques** — essential steps for any machine learning or data analysis pipeline.
